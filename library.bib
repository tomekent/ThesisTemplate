@article{Antoine2004,
abstract = {The objective of this research is to investigate the trade-off between operating cost and environmental acceptability of commercial aircraft. This involves optimizing the aircraft design and mission to minimize operating cost while constraining exterior noise and emissions. Growth in air traffic and airport neighboring communities has resulted in increased pressure to severely penalize airlines that do not meet strict local noise and emissions requirements. As a result, environmental concerns have become potent driving forces in commercial aviation. Traditionally, aircraft have been first designed to meet performance and cost goals, and adjusted to satisfy the environmental requirements at given airports. The focus of the present study is to determine the feasibility of including noise and emissions constraints in the early design of the aircraft and mission. This paper introduces the design tool and results from a case study involving a 250-passenger airliner.},

The algorithm studied is policy iteration where in successive iterations the action-value functions of the intermediate policies are obtained by means of approximate value iteration. PAC-style polynomial bounds are derived on the number of samples needed to guarantee near-optimal performance. The bounds depend on the mixing rate of the trajectory, the smoothness properties of the underlying Markovian decision problem, the approximation power and capacity of the function set used. One of the main novelties of the paper is that new smoothness constraints are introduced thereby significantly extending the scope of previous results.},

@article{Babikian2002,
abstract = {The air transport industry has grown at an average annual rate of 9\% worldwide since 1960 and is expected to experience 5\% annual growth worldwide for the foreseeable future. Recently, this rapid growth has fueled concern about the contribution of aviation activities to global climate change. Governments, airlines and manufacturers are currently debating the feasibility and effectiveness of various strategies aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of aircraft emissions. Policy responses including the implementation of taxes, emissions trading schemes, environmental charges and voluntary agreements between airlines and governments are all being considered. In order to design effective approaches towards emissions reduction, there is a need to understand the mechanisms that have enabled historical improvements in aircraft efficiency. This thesis focuses on the impact regional aircraft have had on the efficiency of the U.S. aviation system, and examines how the technological, operational and cost characteristics of turboprop and regional jet aircraft have influenced the fuel efficiency of the regional aircraft fleet. These characteristics have been compared to larger narrow and wide body aircraft, providing two different perspectives on technology evolution, airline operations and the impact of costs on both. Regional aircraft are playing an increasingly important role in the evolution of U.S. airline operations. In particular, the widespread adoption of the regional jet is transforming the aviation landscape by expanding hub operations, replacing larger jets in low-density markets, replacing turboprops in shorthaul markets, and opening up new hub-bypass routes. The impact of this transformation on congestion and aircraft emission issues is not yet obvious, but there is potential to exacerbate existing problems. Regional aircraft consum more fuel per unit of passenger travel than larger aircraft and they take up considerable space at already congested airports. Although they currently perform just under 4\% of domestic revenue passenger miles in the U.S., they account for almost 7\% of jet fuel use by U.S. airlines, and for 40\% to 50\% of departures at U.S. airports. In addition, regional traffic is expected to grow 7\% to 8\% annually in the U.S. during the next decade compared to 4\%-6\% for the major U.S. commercial airlines. Comparisons show that regional aircraft are 40\%-60\% less fuel efficient than their larger counterparts, while regional jets are 10\%-60\% less fuel efficient than turboprops. It is revealed that fuel efficiency differences can largely be explained by distinctions in aircraft operations. Aircraft flying short stage lengths spend approximately 15\% more time on the ground for each hour spent in the air than longer flying aircraft, therefore consuming more fuel while taxing and maneuvering at airports. They also spend between 20\% and 60\% of their airborne time climbing to altitude, at 4 associated high levels of fuel consumption, compared to approximately 10\% for large aircraft. In this respect, turboprops are shown to be more efficient than regional jets because they are designed to fly at lower altitudes. As a result of these operational differences between aircraft types, large aircraft realize total energy efficiencies much closer to their optimum rate of efficiency achieved during cruise flight than regional aircraft. The total rate of fuel consumption of regional aircraft was found to be 2.7 times higher than rate of fuel consumption achieved during cruise flight. For large aircraft, the total rate of fuel consumption was only 1.6 times higher than at cruise. A similar comparison of regional aircraft revealed that the total fuel consumption of regional jets was on average more than 3.5 times as high as that achieved at cruise, while for turboprops this figure was closer to 2.3 times as high. It is also shown that regional airlines have been able to operate regional jets at higher load factors than turboprops, such that the energy consumed per unit of passenger travel for regional jets and turboprops has been comparable, even though turboprops have higher fuel efficiencies. The economic characteristics of regional aircraft were also examined. Direct operating costs per RPM are shown to be 2-6 times higher for regional aircraft because they perform fewer miles over which to spread fixed costs incurred every time an aircraft performs a flight, regardless of distance flown. The higher operating costs of regional aircraft are consistent with the yields of regional airlines, which in 1999 were on average 2 times higher than those of large airlines.},

abstract = {Simulated annealing is a probabilistic method proposed in Kirkpatrick, Gelett and Vecchi (1983) and Cerny (1985) for finding the global minimum of a cost function that may possess several local minima. It works by emulating the physical process whereby a solid is slowly cooled so that when eventually its structure is "frozen," this happens at a minimum energy configuration. We restrict ourselves to the case of a cost function defined on a finite set. Extensions of simulated annealing to the case of functions defined on continuous sets have also been introduced in the literature (e.g., Geman and Hwang, 1986; Gidas, 1985a; Holley, Kusuoka and Stroock, 1989; Jeng and Woods, 1990; Kushner, 1985).

Flight test of the enhanced auto-pilot to accomplish this was demonstrated in Oct 2012, obtaining a savings of 5-10\% fuel burn and capturing data on the effects on the airframe, engines, and aircrew for a representative transport aircraft, the C- 17. Additional flight tests more representative of complete missions were performed in July 2013. For extended durations greater than 90 minutes, fuel burn savings exceeded 10\% and were accomplished fully automated.

The conclusions of the paper are (1) large reductions in induced drag are possible, (2) optimal formations have lighter aircraft in front and heavier aircraft in the rear, (3) optimal cruise altitude of a formation is much higher than an equivalent single aircraft, (4) the ability to accurately maintain lateral position is critical. 50\% of the drag benefit is lost if the lateral/vertical position cannot be maintained to better than 1/10th of the wingspan.},

abstract = {The deregulation of US domestic passenger aviation in 1978 resulted in the reconfiguration of airline networks into radial route systems, spatially concentrated around a small number of central airports or 'hubs'. This paper investigates whether a similar spatial concentration trend can be observed in the European aviation network after deregulation at the airline network level. Using the network concentration index, it is demonstrated that European 'flag carriers' already showed a very high traffic concentration rate at the beginning of deregulation. Between 1990 and 1999, the distribution of European traffic of these carriers remained remarkably stable according to the network concentration index. A spatial concentration trend of European traffic on a small number of hubs can only be observed for some regional airlines. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fifty-four skeins of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) were photographed from directly underneath to eliminate the effects of perspective distortion, and the wing-tip spacings (the distance between adjacent birds' wing tips perpendicular to the flight path at maximum wingspan) and depths (the distance between adjacent birds' body centres parallel to the flight path) were measured at the same time as local wind speeds. The photographs were used to test for savings in induced power from wing positioning relative to the predicted positions of vortices generated by other wings, using a theoretical model. The mean wing-tip spacing corresponded to a saving in induced power of 14\%, less than one-third of the maximum possible. The saving in total power might be as low as 2.4\%. The high variation in wing-tip spacing suggests that pink-footed geese found difficulty maintaining position and thus adopted a strategy of flying outboard of the optimal position that maximises savings. This may minimise the risk of straying into a zone where savings are negative. There was a significant correlation between depth and wing-tip spacing, supporting an alternative communication hypothesis, whereby the birds position themselves to obtain maximum information on their neighbour's position. In high winds, there was little change in wing-tip spacing variation but a decrease in depth variation, suggesting a shift towards more regularly spaced skeins.},

abstract = {Today, many low cost carriers (LCCs) continue to enjoy rapid growth and still have a fair number of new aircraft on order. There are signs however that the market for LCCs is limited, owing to increasing route density problems, primarily in Europe but seemingly also in North America: the fact that average frequencies have decreased and average route distances increased since 2001 indicate that LCCs are increasingly operating in exceedingly thinner niche markets. This perhaps explains why LCCs have been trying to adapt their business strategies to assure future growth by shifting to primary airports, facilitating transfers, engaging in codesharing, entering alliances, and acquiring other airlines. This paper identifies the possible factors limiting the LCC model's growth and explains how the largest LCCs in Europe and the US have subsequently reacted. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article presents a reinforcement learning framework for continuous-time dynamical systems without a priori discretization of time, state, and action. Based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for infinite-horizon, discounted reward problems, we derive algorithms for estimating value functions and improving policies with the use of function approximators. The process of value function estimation is formulated as the minimization of a continuous-time form of the temporal difference (TD) error. Update methods based on backward Euler approximation and exponential eligibility traces are derived, and their correspondences with the conventional residual gradient, TD(0), and TD(lambda) algorithms are shown. For policy improvement, two methods-a continuous actor-critic method and a value-gradient-based greedy policy-are formulated. As a special case of the latter, a nonlinear feedback control law using the value gradient and the model of the input gain is derived. The advantage updating, a model-free algorithm derived previously, is also formulated in the HJB-based framework. The performance of the proposed algorithms is first tested in a nonlinear control task of swinging a pendulum up with limited torque. It is shown in the simulations that (1) the task is accomplished by the continuous actor-critic method in a number of trials several times fewer than by the conventional discrete actor-critic method; (2) among the continuous policy update methods, the value-gradient-based policy with a known or learned dynamic model performs several times better than the actor-critic method; and (3) a value function update using exponential eligibility traces is more efficient and stable than that based on Euler approximation. The algorithms are then tested in a higher-dimensional task: cart-pole swing-up. This task is accomplished in several hundred trials using the value-gradient-based policy with a learned dynamic model.},

abstract = {Many options for mitigating aviation's environmental impact rely on introduction of new aircraft technology, retrofits or early retirement of older aircraft. Using a global fleet database, we analyse aircraft lifecycles and their interaction with fuel price, demand, policy and economic cycles. Simple relationships, including aircraft retirement curves, are estimated to allow insight into the effectiveness and timescales of emissions reductions from these measures. We find variations in retirement age and retrofits have historically had little effect on global emissions. The design and purchasing stages offer a more promising target, subject to long timescales and demand growth rates. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = { The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used widely in signal processing for efficient computation of the FT of finite-length signals over a set of uniformly spaced frequency locations. However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The min-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.},

Trailing aircraft are able to recover some of this energy by properly positioning themselves with respect to this wake. As part of the Formation Flight for Aerodynamic Benefit Program, several full scale flights tests were conducted using United States Air Force C-17s that demonstrated greater than 10\% fuel burn savings for the trailing aircraft could be autonomously achieved over long durations. Not obvious, however, is how these fuel savings will translate to the C-17 fleet as a whole and what the operational impacts of the technology will be. To address these questions, analysis tools for analyzing and optimizing aircraft formations and route networks were developed. These tools were then applied to historical data for flights into and out of the U.S. Northern Command to predict potential efficiency gains and the associated operational costs.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of wake vortices shed by commercial aircraft. It presents a consolidated European view on the current status of knowledge of the nature and characteristics of aircraft wakes and of technical and operational procedures of minimizing and predicting the vortex strength and avoiding wake encounters. Methodological aspects of data evaluation and interpretation, like the description of wake ages, the characterization of wake vortices, and the proper evaluation of wake data from measurement and simulation, are addressed in the first part. In the second part an inventory of our knowledge is given on vortex characterization and control, prediction and monitoring of vortex decay, vortex detection and warning, vortex encounter models, and wake-vortex safety assessment. Each section is concluded by a list of questions and required actions which may help to guide further research activities. The primary objective of the joint international efforts in wake-vortex research is to avoid potentially hazardous wake encounters for aircraft. Shortened aircraft separations under appropriate meteorological conditions, whilst keeping or even increasing the safety level, is the ultimate goal. Reduced time delays on the tactical side and increased airport capacities on the strategic side will be the benefits of these ambitious ventures for the air transportation industry and services. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {We analyze the global structure of the worldwide air transportation network, a critical infrastructure with an enormous impact on local, national, and international economies. We find that the worldwide air transportation network is a scale-free small-world network. In contrast to the prediction of scale-free network models, however, we find that the most connected cities are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multicommunity structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints and that geopolitical considerations have to be taken into account. We identify each city's global role based on its pattern of intercommunity and intracommunity connections, which enables us to obtain scale-specific representations of the network.},

abstract = {Two primary concerns motivate the consideration of alternatives to conventional petroleum derived jet fuel in commercial aviation: price and environmental effects. From 2003 through mid-2008, the rise in world oil prices led to a commensurate rise in the price of petroleum products, including jet fuel. In the process, the high price of jet fuel contributed to the bank- ruptcy of several airlines and was one factor motivating other airlines to merge. All economic sectors, including aviation, are experiencing growing pressure to reduce their greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Aviation, however, has fewer alternative-energy options to petroleum-based fuels. In addition to contributing to global climate change, emissions from aviation degrade air quality...},

abstract = {This article describes an approach to close-formation flight of autonomous aircraft. A standard LQ-based structure was synthesized for each vehicle and for formation position error control using linearized equations of motion and a lifting line model of the aircraft wake. We also consider the definition of a formation management structure, capable of dealing with a variety of generic transmission and communication failures among aircraft. The procedure was developed using a decentralized approach and relies on the Dijkstra algorithm. The algorithm provides optimal path information sequencing in the nominal case, as well as the redundancy needed to accommodate failures in data transmission and reception. Several simulations were carried out, and some of the results are presented. The overall scheme appears to be a valuable starting point for further research, especially specialization to situations representing more detailed and operational failures.},

abstract = {We propose a novel approach to optimize Partially Observable Markov Decisions Processes (POMDPs) defined on continuous spaces. To date, most algorithms for model-based POMDPs are restricted to discrete states, actions, and observations, but many real-world problems such as, for instance, robot navigation, are naturally defined on continuous spaces. In this work, we demonstrate that the value function for continuous POMDPs is convex in the beliefs over continuous state spaces, and piecewise-linear convex for the particular case of discrete observations and actions but still continuous states. We also demonstrate that continuous Bellman backups are contracting and isotonic ensuring the monotonic convergence of value-iteration algorithms. Relying on those properties, we extend the algorithm, originally developed for discrete POMDPs, to work in continuous state spaces by representing the observation, transition, and reward models using Gaussian mixtures, and the beliefs using Gaussian mixtures or particle sets. With these representations, the integrals that appear in the Bellman backup can be computed in closed form and, therefore, the algorithm is computationally feasible. Finally, we further extend to deal with continuous action and observation sets by designing effective sampling approaches.},

abstract = {The interdependency of aircraft technological systems, the global reach of the aviation transport industry, and the uncertainty surrounding potential atmospheric effects have made defining the relationship between aviation and environmental impact an arduous task. Air travel continues to experience the fastest growth of all modes of transport, and although the energy intensity of the aviation transport system continues to decline, fuel use and total emissions have steadily risen. This trend, which represents a conflict between growth and environmental impact, has motivated the aircraft manufacturing and airline industries, the scientific community, and governmental bodies to consider what pace of emissions reduction is acceptable. This paper analyzes the historical influence of aircraft performance on cost to examine the potential pace of future efficiency improvements and emissions reduction. Technological and operational influences on aircraft energy intensity are quantified and correlated with direct operating cost and aircraft price using analytical and statistical models built upon historical data for US airlines. The energy intensity reduction potential and economic characteristics of future aircraft are also projected, through extrapolations of historical trends in aircraft technology and operations.

abstract = {This paper analyzes the growth and evolution of topological features of the US airline network over a 20-year period. It captures the change in the network system from different dimensions of complex networks such as centrality distribution and various structural properties of the network over time. We first illustrate the results of a set of measures, including degree, strength, betweenness centrality, and clustering structure. The geographic features of airport systems, spatial distance and network efficiency are also discussed in this section. In order to further capture the dynamics of the system, this paper also explores the correlation between different measures, and investigates various interactions inside the network. Overall this study offers a novel approach to understanding the growth and evolution of real physical networks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Formation flight of birds improves aerodynamic efficiency. Theoretically, 25 birds could have a range increase of about 70 percent as compared with a lone bird, the advantage being more pronounced when there is a tail wind. A vee formation is required to equally distribute the drag saving, and, contrary to other statements, the lead bird does not necessarily have the most strenuous position. The angle of the predicted vee compares with that observed in nature; stability mechanisms are described which make it easy and natural for the bird to sense optimal formations.},

abstract = {The efficient management of air traffic during convective weather in regions of congested air space is a very difficult task. Significant efforts have been underway for many years to provide improved forecasts of convective weather to traffic flow managers to help them increase air space usage efficiency during these times. However, due to the increased workload created by convective weather impacting the air traffic routes and other factors, increased forecast performance may not translate directly into more efficient operations. In recent years, automated decision support tools have been under development to assist traffic managers in more effectively utilizing the improved forecast products. These tools are designed to integrate deterministic or probabilistic forecasts of convective weather into impacts on predetermined air traffic routes in the national air space (NAS)},

abstract = {In this paper the effects of the strategic interaction between deregulated airlines on their network choice are analysed. We examine whether switching from a linear to a hub-spoke network confers a strategic advantage because it saves costs and improves service quality. We find that if hubbing lowers total cost (which includes both airline and passenger inconvenience costs), the pursuit of strategic advantages usually intensifies the extent of hubbing. Even if hubbing raises total cost, it might be pursued by the airline, either because hubbing is a dominant strategy in an oligopolistic setting or because hubbing will be useful in deterring entry.},

abstract = {The geometry and magnetization (spin distribution) of the series of flat hexagonal zigzag edged molecules C(6m∗∗2)H(6m) (m = 1,2, ..., 10) in their lowest triplet state (S(z) = 1) has been calculated using density functional theory and a connection established from the known benzene (m = 1) triplets to the triplets and singlet ground state of the largest molecules (m = 9, 10). The triplet state potential energy surface has two minima corresponding to distortions from the ground state geometry, such that CC bonds bisected by a C(2)" rotation axis are either longer or shorter. For both geometries, the spin on the carbon atoms forms a pattern that peaks at the middle of an edge and for large index (m) values is the same (apart from sign) as the edge pattern of the hexagonally sectored singlet radical ground state of the largest member C(600)H(60). This similarity suggests that the singlet ground state of the larger (m = 9, 10) zigzag edged hexangulenes is possibly a hex-radical, in some ways analogous to the di- and higher multiradical ground state of the linear acenes C(4m + 2)H(2m + 4) starting around m ≥ 8 and 9. The spin patterns provide guidance in interpreting the multiradical nature of ground and low lying excited states of large hexangulenes and how magnetism evolves with size in molecules with graphene cores.},

abstract = {Many species travel in highly organized groups. The most quoted function of these configurations is to reduce energy expenditure and enhance locomotor performance of individuals in the assemblage. The distinctive V formation of bird flocks has long intrigued researchers and continues to attract both scientific and popular attention. The well-held belief is that such aggregations give an energetic benefit for those birds that are flying behind and to one side of another bird through using the regions of upwash generated by the wings of the preceding bird, although a definitive account of the aerodynamic implications of these formations has remained elusive. Here we show that individuals of northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) flying in a V flock position themselves in aerodynamically optimum positions, in that they agree with theoretical aerodynamic predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that birds show wingtip path coherence when flying in V positions, flapping spatially in phase and thus enabling upwash capture to be maximized throughout the entire flap cycle. In contrast, when birds fly immediately behind another bird--in a streamwise position--there is no wingtip path coherence; the wing-beats are in spatial anti-phase. This could potentially reduce the adverse effects of downwash for the following bird. These aerodynamic accomplishments were previously not thought possible for birds because of the complex flight dynamics and sensory feedback that would be required to perform such a feat. We conclude that the intricate mechanisms involved in V formation flight indicate awareness of the spatial wake structures of nearby flock-mates, and remarkable ability either to sense or predict it. We suggest that birds in V formation have phasing strategies to cope with the dynamic wakes produced by flapping wings.},

The first section of this study analyses the global fossil fuel market and the historical trend of real and nominal fossil fuel prices from 1950 to 2008. Historical fossil fuel price analysis shows that coal prices are decreasing, while natural gas prices are increasing. The second section reviews previously available price modelling techniques and proposes a new comprehensive version of the long-term trend reverting jump and dip diffusion model. The third section uses the new model to forecast fossil fuel prices in nominal and real terms from 2009 to 2018. The new model follows the extrapolation of the historical sinusoidal trend of nominal and real fossil fuel prices. The historical trends show an increase in nominal/real oil and natural gas prices plus nominal coal prices, as well as a decrease in real coal prices. Furthermore, the new model forecasts that oil, natural gas and coal will stay in jump for the next couple of years and after that they will revert back to the long-term trend until 2018.},

abstract = {Crude oil, coal and gas, known as fossil fuels, play a crucial role in the global economy. This paper proposes new econometrics modelling to demonstrate the trend of fossil fuels consumption. The main variables affecting consumption trends are: world reserves, the price of fossil fuels, US production and US net imports. All variables have been analysed individually for more than half a century. The research found that while the consumption of fossil fuels worldwide has increased trends in the US production and net imports have been dependent on the type of fossil fuels. Most of the US coal and gas production has been for domestic use, which is why it does not have a strong influence on worldwide fossil fuel prices. Moreover, the reserves of fossil fuels have not shown any diminution during the last couple of decades and predictions that they were about to run out are not substantiated. The nominal and real price of fossil fuels was found to change depending on the type. Finally, estimates of three econometric models for the consumption of fossil fuels from 1949 to 2006 are presented which identify the effects of significant variables.

abstract = {Decentralized overlapping feedback laws are designed for a formation of unmanned aerial vehicles. The dynamic model of the formation with an information structure constraint in which each vehicle, except the leader, only detects the vehicle directly in front of it, is treated as an interconnected system with overlapping subsystems. Using the mathematical framework of the inclusion principle, the interconnected system is expanded into a higher dimensional space in which the subsystems appear to be disjoint. Then, at each subsystem, a static state feedback controller is designed to robustly stabilize the perturbed nominal dynamics of the subsystem. The design procedure is based on the application of convex optimization tools involving linear matrix inequalities. As a final step, the decentralized controllers are contracted back to the original interconnected system for implementation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The influences of the leader in a group of V flight formation are dealt with. The investigation is focused on the effect of its position and shape on aerodynamics performances of a given V flight formation. Vortices generated the wing tip of the leader moves downstream forming a pair of opposite rotating line vortices. These vortices are generally undesirable because they create a downwash that increases the induced drag on leaders wing. However, this downwash is also accompanied by an upwash that can beneficial to the followers wing flying behind the leaders one, namely a favorable lift for the followers wing. How much contributions of the leaders wing to the followers wing in the V formation flight is determined by the strength of tip vortices generated by the leaders wing which is influenced by its position and shape including incidence angle, dihedral angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio. The prediction of aerodynamic performances of the V flight formation including lift, drag and moment coefficients is numerically performed by solving Navier Stokes equations with k e turbulence model. The computational domain is defined with multiblock topology to capture the complex geometry arrangement of the V flight formation.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {This paper uses a complex network approach to examine the network structure and nodal centrality of individual cities in the air transport network of China (ATNC). Measures for overall network structure include degree distribution, average path length and clustering coefficient. Centrality metrics for individual cities are degree, closeness and betweenness, representing a node's location advantage as being directly connected to others, being accessible to others, and being the intermediary between others, respectively. Results indicate that the ATNC has a cumulative degree distribution captured by an exponential function, and displays some small-world (SW) network properties with an average path length of 2.23 and a clustering coefficient of 0.69. All three centrality indices are highly correlated with socio-economic indicators of cities such as air passenger volume, population, and gross regional domestic product (GRDP). This confirms that centrality captures a crucial aspect of location advantage in the ATNC and has important implications in shaping the spatial pattern of economic activities. Most small and low-degree airports are directly connected to the largest cities with the best centrality and bypass their regional centers, and therefore sub-networks in the ATNC are less developed except for Kunming in the southwest and Urumchi in the northwest because of their strategic locations for geographic and political reasons. The ANTC is relatively young, and not as efficient and well-developed as that of the US. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many species of large bird fly together in formation, perhaps because flight power demands and energy expenditure can be reduced when the birds fly at an optimal spacing, or because orientation is improved by communication within groups. We have measured heart rates as an estimate of energy expenditure in imprinted great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus) trained to fly in 'V' formation, and show that these birds save a significant amount of energy by flying in formation. This advantage is probably a principal reason for the evolution of flight formation in large birds that migrate in groups.},
